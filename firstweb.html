        <h1 align='center'>About Me.</h1>
        <p align='center'>My name is Rose Whitt and I guess you could say that I am just your typical high school girl.
        I hang out with my friends all the time, whether it’s riding around, chilling at someone’s house, hanging out at a social event, or cheering on the football team, I’ll be there.
        My personality tends to be the wild card type. I am outgoing and an extravert most of the time, but I always need time to recharge.
        Sometimes I sit quietly in a group setting and sometimes I’m the loud and crazy one.
        I rarely take things seriously; I’d always much rather crack a joke than give good advice, but you’ll only see that side of me when it’s a smaller group.
        </p>  
        
        <p align='center'> I always speak my mind, which sometimes gets me in trouble but I believe some things need to be said, no matter the controversy it may cause.
        I believe that everyone deserves to hear the truth and no one should ever have to feel like they need to keep an opinion in just because someone might disagree.
        However, I am not saying that I walk up to someone and tell them that their shirt is ugly or that their boyfriend is stupid, I do have manners.
        I am very politically active; if there is something I believe in, I will do everything I can to show others the importance of the topic.
        </p>
        
        <p align='center'> My family really values traveling and learning about different cultures so when I turned five we began to travel across the country for up to six weeks every summer,
        all by car, and ultimately visiting every state by the time I turned thirteen.
        These experiences have shaped the person I am today because I know that there is more out there than just the small southern town that I live in.
        </p>
        
        <p align='center'>I really enjoy working out. I have run cross country and track for 5 years and I love playing about every other sport.
        I grew up playing sports so I have always been naturally decent at about any sport you put in front of me, which always makes everything way more fun.
        </p>
        
        <p align='center'>My family is pretty typical. I have two parents, one sister 4 years older than me, and one set of grandparents on my dad’s side and a grandpa on my mom’s side.
        My dad played golf at Clemson University and is still a really good golfer to this day, despite juggling being a teacher and a great dad.
        My mom is an accountant who loves to travel and learn about the world.
        She didn’t get to travel when she was a kid so she has made sure that we have gotten to see this beautiful world at any chance we get.
        My sister goes to The University of Richmond and is a very caring and warm hearted person.
